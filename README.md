# RAG Application Using Google PaLM

Welcome to the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application repository! This project demonstrates how to build a powerful RAG application utilizing Google's PaLM (Pathways Language Model) to enhance information retrieval and generation.

## Introduction

The RAG framework combines retrieval and generation to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. By integrating Google's PaLM model, this application leverages advanced language understanding and generation capabilities to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Utilizes Google's PaLM model to retrieve and generate responses based on input queries.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the application.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Designed for efficient performance and scalability.

## Installation

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/meeravali19/RAG-application_using_googlepalm.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd RAG-application_using_googlepalm
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
    Start the application with the following command:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
2. **Interact with the Interface**:
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to start using the application.

## Configuration

To configure the application, you need to set up your Google PaLM API credentials. Follow these steps:

1. **Obtain API Credentials**:
    - Sign up for access to Google PaLM and obtain your API key.
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API credentials:
      ```
      GOOGLE_PALM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
      ```
